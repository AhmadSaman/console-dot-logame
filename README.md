# Console Logame
 Console Logame is an interactive console-based game that tests your knowledge of JavaScript through multiple-choice questions. With various game modes to choose from, it offers an engaging way to enhance your JavaScript skills and have fun at the same time.

## Modes
 - Casual: 
      nothing interesting just random questions coming again and again 
 - Nerds(coming soon): 
      this one is interesting, there will be a timer, and the timer based on your answer will decrease and increase(right answer +SET_AMOUNT_OF_OF_SEC, wrong answer -SET_AMOUNT_OF_OF_SEC), and to make it more challenging there will be a leaderboard(will be an MD file showing top 100 gamers)⚠️feel free to work on this feature⚠️
